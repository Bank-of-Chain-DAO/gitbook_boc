BOC","keywords":"","body":"Introduction to BOC\nWhat is BOC\nBOC (Bank Of Chain) is a new and innovative platform on the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It helps ordinary users to obtain a near \"risk-free\" wealth management tool on the blockchain.\nThe BOC platform connects carefully selected protocols within the crypto ecosystem, including Automatic Market Makers (AMMs), lending protocols, yield aggregators, among others. (see Dashboard for details).\nBy accessing high-quality protocol and smart strategies, BOC provides a 4-5% more APY than other similar USD managed funds.\nFor newcomers to the crypto industry, this is the best way to start on the DeFi ecosystem. As a one-click protocol BOC will bring a new revolution to the DeFi industry, attracting hundreds of millions of dollars of investment.\nBOC Source of Yield\nBOC is a DeFi protocol that provides the best long-term near \"risk-free\" return. Depending on the strategy the sources of yield come from:\n\nThe transaction fee charged for providing market-making funds to decentralized exchanges (DEX).\nThe interest charged on funds borrowed for over-collateralized loans.\nGovernance token's rewards.\n\nFund Allocation Rules\n\nHigh-yield liquidity pools have allocation priority.\nThe capital invested in a single liquidity pool cannot exceed 20% of the total assets under management.\nThe capital allocated to a single liquidity pool cannot exceed 50% of their existing lock-up amount.\nThe total capital invested on different liquidity pools from the same protocol cannot exceed 30% of the total assets under management.\nFunds allocation is adjusted automatically to ensure the most cost-efficient position.\n\nThe existing DeFi protocols present the following problems:\n\nImpermanent losses in decentralized exchanges from market makers. In 2021, UniswapV3’s market-making revenue was about $200 million, but those pools have suffered impermanent losses of $260 million, resulting in a total net loss of $60 million.\nCircular dependencies for yield aggregators.\nHigh investment thresholds.\nPresent a complex user interface and requires a high-expertice on DeFi investments.\nRequirement of multiple cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat makes BOC different?\nBOC is the first Decentralized Bank (DeB), where you can deposit your crypto assets and automatically BOC´s smart contracts will perform decentralized investing by carefully running selected strategies on different high-quality DeFi protocols to create long-term stable income near \"risk-free\".\nThe main characteristics that make BOC a unique product are:\nIt's just like a bank:\n\nBank-like user interface.\nUsers can deposit and withdraw directly without considering the difficulties of implementing complex operations such as farming, exchange, and reallocation. BOC makes the best selection for them.\nHistorical and dynamic returns are intuitively visible.\n\n\nBank-like service.\nWealth management tool on the blockchain.\nLendings (to be implemented)\n\n\nBank-deposit like tokens (USDi & ETHi):\nFully liquid.\nInterest-bearing.\nFully backed.\n1:1 pegged.\n\n\n\nIt's better than other DeFi protocols:\n\nThe strategies and movement of funds has full transparency.\nProvides a sustainable yield.\nPerform a due diligence to all stakeholders before working with them.\nIt's dummy-proof.\n\nSafety it's a priority:\n\nThe market cap of qualified stablecoins exceeds 1 billion dollars.\nThe TVL of qualified Blockchains exceeds 5 billion dollars.\nIt has third party auditing in place.\nBOC does not use unofficial third-party cross-chain bridges for transactions.\nIts oracles attack proof, the price quotation relies on Chainlink, a market-leading oracle.\n\nHas risk control measures:\n\nIt minimizes the de-anchoring risk of stablecoins.\nIt plays down the risk of impermanent loss, BOC use market-making for stablecoin pairs only.\nThe systemic risk is optimized by the very selective wrapped tokens and yield aggregators.\nAlgorithmic stablecoin are NOT allowed.\nAny leverage function is provided.\nCircular dependency is constantly studied for being avoided.\n\nSmart automation:\n\nYields are regularly calibrated, weighing the cost and reward for funds reallocation.\nIt regularly searches for the best rate through exchange aggregators.\nBOC performs FX interest swap, adjusting FX synthesis based on exchange rate and yield.\nParameters are automatically set for market-making and lending strategy.\n\nIn summary, BOC Platform is the missing catalyst that will revolutionize the industry generating a new way to interact with the DeFi Ecosystem, making it a safe path for newcomers. This will lead to a new market growth compared to other similar products in the market:\n\n\n\nComparing Product\nBOC\nYearn\nOUSD\nAladdin DAO\nEnzyme\nFarming\nBeefy\nAlpha\nYield app\n\n\n\n\nType\nDeFi Bank\nYield Aggregator\nStablecoin\nYield Aggregator\nOn-chain asset management\nYield Aggregator\nYield Aggregator\nYield Aggregator\nDeFi Bank\n\n\nDetails\nBOC is a DeFi protocol that provides the best long-term risk-free return.\nYearn Finance is a suite of products in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that provides yield generation, lending aggregation, and more on the blockchain.\nOrigin Dollar (OUSD) is a new stablecoin that was initially launched on the Ethereum network.\nAladdinDAO is a decentralized network to shift crypto investments from venture capitalists to wisdom of crowds through collective value discovery.\nFast & cost-effective way to build, scale and monetize investment strategies.Fast & cost-effective way to build, scale and monetize investment strategies.\nHarvest Finance is a yield farming protocol that lets users put their assets to work in high-producing farming opportunities.\nBeefy Finance is a Decentralized, Multi-Chain Yield Optimizer that allows its users to earn compound interest on their crypto holdings.

First, to complete the investment in BOC we need to start on the user investment page. We go to the home page and click on LAUNCH APP button.\n\nWallet Connection\nWe can interact with BOC through wallets, the APP is compatible MetaMask and WalletConnect, by clicking on the CONNECT WALLET button.\n\nAfter connecting the wallet, we can see the USDT balance in our account.\n\nParameter Settings\nCross-chain Bridge\nBOC provides cross-chain bridge options, in case it's necessary to do cross-chain operations.\n\nSwitch Chain\nAt the present, BOC works on Ethereum, BNB Chain and Polygon. If we need to switch chains, they can do it through NETWORKS.\n\nInvestment and Redemption\nDeposit\nOnce the wallet has been successfully connected, we can complete the deposit by choosing the vault we what to use, on the USDi Vault we will have the stablecoin to use and selecting the desired amount and then clicking on DEPOSIT.\n\nOn the ETHi Vault we will have the possibility of investing ETH by selecting the desired amount and then clicking on DEPOSIT.\n\nThe ETHi Vault differently to the USDi Vault has a gas fee estimation.\nWithdrawal\nAfter successfully connecting the wallet, we can complete the withdrawal by selecting vault we what to do use, on the USDi Vault is the possibility to withdraw a single stablecoin or mix we complete with the desired USDi and clicking WITHDRAW.\n\nOn the ETHi Vault there is the possibility to withdraw only ETH we complete with the desired ETHi and clicking WITHDRAW.\n\nExchanged: Exchange function enablement. Each strategy in the BOC uses different stablecoins. When we withdraw money, we will do it according to the strategy APY from low to high. If a non-USDT strategy is obtained, the stable currency of the corresponding strategy will be returned, e.g. if Yearn LUSD is obtained, LUSD will be returned and if the exchange is closed, the corresponding value of LUSD will be returned to our account. If redemption is enabled, the Slippage parameter needs to be set.\nWithdrawal Advanced Parameters\n\nThe advanced setup parameters are:\nMax Loss: The maximum loss on withdrawals. When we specify the amount of USDi to withdrawal, the total assets at the current net value will be displayed, but these are not the funds we can finally get, and losses may occur during the withdrawal process, including exchange slippage losses. If our total assets are estimated to be $1000 at this time, and we choose Max Loss=0.3%, then we will get no less than $997.\nSlippage: Slippage between different currencies. After enabling Exchanged, we need to specify the slippage that we accept.\nAdding USDi and ETHi to your wallet\nIf the USDi is not shown on your wallet, you need to add it manually, we make it really easy you just to click on the + next to your USDi balance and press Add Token. Then you will see you USDi balance on your metamask wallet.\n\n\nAnalogously, ETHi can be added to the wallet in the same way.\n\nDashboard\nFrom the dashboard we can get the next relevant information about our assets and protocols that interact with them.\nhttps://dashboard.bankofchain.io\n\nEach data is described as follows:\n\nOn-chain Vault lock-up amount, read the subgraph interface.\nThe number of investment users, read the subgraph interface.\nAPY for the last 30 days based on net worth.\nProportion of protocol funds, query the subgraph interface.\nThe total assets of each strategy, read the contract interface.\nOfficial APY, regularly pulled every morning.\nCurrency standard weekly profit, weekly APY.\nStrategy Address.\nVault operation records, displayed with the blockchain browser.\n\nBOC subgraph:\n\nETH: https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/bankofchain/boc-subgraph-eth\nBNB: https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/bankofchain/boc-subgraph-bsc\nPOLYGON: https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/bankofchain/boc-subgraph-matic\n\nStrategy Details\nTake SushiUsdcUsdtStrategy as an example, enter the strategy details page as shown in the figure:\n\nEach data is described as follows:\n\nStrategy Details\nStrategy name\nStablecoins accepted by the strategy\nThe current total assets of the strategy (valued in USDT)\nThe total assets of the strategy's historical investment (valued in USDT)\n\n\nStrategy Historical Return APY Performance\nHistorical official APY(yellow line)\nHistorical weekly APY(blue line)\n\n\nTotal Strategy Assets (Currency Standard)\nStrategy operation asset changes (currency standard)\nStrategy Action Type\n“harvest:: The strategy completes a mine sale and reinvestment, and reports the total asset valuation\n“lend”: Vault puts funds into the strategy, and this action occurs in fund allocation (“doHardWork”, “allocation”)\n“redeem”: Vault withdraws funds from the strategy, and this action occurs in the allocation of funds (“allocation”)\n\n\n\nPersonal Investment Analysis\nEnter the personal investment analysis page to see the personal investment income.\n Each data is described as follows:\n\nPersonal investment total asset valuation (calculated in USDT).\nAcquired BOC share.\nPass 30 days APY.\nUnwithdrawn earnings (calculated in USDT).\nWithdrawn earnings (calculated in USDT).\nHistorical personal total assets.\nMonthly income.\n\n"},"boc/governance.html":{"url":"boc/governance.html","title":"Governance","keywords":"","body":"Governance\nBOC is a disruptive blockchain innovation that aims to change the DeFi ecosystem.

Before entering DeFi, users must understand investment and smart contract risks. This section focuses on the risks associated with BOC.\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of security measures that were implemented.\n\nTo be able to avoid losses caused by code vulnerabilities, all protocols shall be audited by reputable auditors.\nTo reduce the risk of oracle attack, the quotation of the stablecoin must be based on a decentralized oracle.\nIn order to avoid the chain system risk caused by nested tokens and LEGO combinations, the access to the aggregated financial management protocol needs to have a long-term security operation record and obtain the voting permission of the community.\nIn order to avoid impermanent losses caused by market fluctuations, the protocol for obtaining capital returns by providing risky services will not be accessed for the time being. At the same time leverage is not being used to magnify capital returns for the time being.\n\nYield Dilution Risk\nThe increased liquidity from big whales can further dilute the yield of investing funds in a particular pool during rebalancing intervals.\nSmart Contract Risk\nSmart contracts due to the complexities, even audited by professionals, can still post risk and are prone to hacks and unforeseeable events.\nMarket Risk\nThe counterparty on the borrower's side lending protocols are also in default risk that cannot be rectified by liquidation in an extreme case of market fluctuation.\nTransaction Cost Risk\nThe automatic rebalancing that was triggered by network congestion will result in high transaction fee (gas fee) and affects the final yield rate.\nOracle Attack Risk\nOracles are the bridge between the blockchain and the real world. Oracles act as on-chain APIs that can be queried for information to smart contracts including but not limited to price information and weather forecasts.\nAn oracle attack is when an oracle is corrupted/attacked and then the data being delivered on-chain may be highly incorrect and lead to smart contracts executing very wrong outcomes. If the oracle used by the third-party protocol strategy connected by BOC is attacked, the benefits of the protocol will no longer be real. This will affect the BOC to make wrong investment decisions based on the wrong quotation, which in turn affects the APY of the BOC.\nTruly overcoming the oracle problem appear decentralized oracles to prevent data manipulation, inaccuracy, and downtime. A Decentralized Oracle Network, or DON for short, combines multiple independent oracle node operators and multiple reliable data sources to establish end-to-end decentralization. BOC uses Chainlink a high-rated decentralized oracle, making oracle attacks really improbable.\n"},"boc/development-planning.html":{"url":"boc/development-planning.html","title":"Development Planning","keywords":"","body":"Development Planning\nRoadmap\n\nFuture Planning\nAlgorithm Optimization\nAt present, the adjustment algorithm only uses a function of scipy “minimize”.

In December 2021, Ethereum became the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin, and the most widely used blockchain.\nThe concept of Ethereum was first proposed between 2013 and 2014 by the programmer Vitalik Buterin after being inspired by Bitcoin as \"the next generation of cryptocurrency and decentralized application platform\". Ethereum's development started through ICO crowdfunding in 2014.\nEthereum is also known as the \"second-generation blockchain platform\", second only to Bitcoin.\nBNB\nBinance Smart Chain (formerly called BSC) is a blockchain compatible with the Ethereum virtual machine in parallel to the Binance Chain. It is a cutting-edge project in the crypto asset industry. By introducing the Proof of Stake Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism, BNB creates a validating ecosystem that allows nodes, token holders, developers and users to enjoy the full benefit of the blockchain, such as higher performance and abundance of innovation space.\nOn February 15, 2022, the cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced that the original Binance Smart Chain (BSC) would be renamed to BNB Chain. BNB is the Binance Exchange platform cryptocurrency that powers the BNB Chain Ecosystem, and is one of the world’s most popular utility tokens.\nPolygon\nPolygon is a protocol for building and interconnecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. The project was launched in India in 2017 under the original name Matic Network. In February 2021, the project name was changed to Polygon. The cryptocurrency of the Polygon project is MATIC, one of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap traded on major exchanges.\nIncorporated Stablecoins\nIn order to avoid the psychological fear caused by the fluctuations of digital currency value and the losses of market-making funds, BOC has selected only stable currency assets(stablecoins), and is only limited to those with full collateral provided by legal currency or by stablecoins.\nStablecoins need to meet the following conditions:\n\nPass audit.\nDon't be an algorithmic stablecoin.\nInsurance available.\nStablecoin quotes must be based on ChainLink.\nMarket capital greater than $1 billion USD.\n\nThe currently selected strategic stablecoins are: DAI, USDC, USDT, BUSD, USDP, TUSD, LUSD.\nDAI\nDAI is a stablecoin cryptocurrency designed to keep its value as close to a dollar as possible through an automated system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.\nUSDC\nUSD Coin (USDC) is a digital stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar that operates on the Ethereum, Stellar, Algorand, Hedera Hashgraph, and Solana blockchains. As of January 2022, USDC in circulation is $45.2 billion.\nUSDT\nUSDT, also known as USDT, is a controversial cryptocurrency issued by Tether Limited, which is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. USDT is a stable currency. Launched in 2014, the coin is a blockchain-based platform that digitally facilitates the use of fiat currencies.\nBUSD\nBinance USD (BUSD) is a new stablecoin launched by Binance and Paxos, which is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar.\nUSDP\nPax Dollar (USDP) is a fiat-collateralized stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar.\nTUSD\nTrueUSD (TUSD) is a USD-pegged stablecoin issued by Trusttoken.\nLUSD\nLUSD is a USD-pegged stablecoin issued by liquidity Protocol.\nProtocol strategy selection\nAfter the stablecoin is selected, its corresponding strategies should meet the following conditions:\n\nDon't have a deposit or withdrawal fees.\nDon't have a lock-up period, so funds can be withdrawn rapidly.\nNo limitation on the amount of funds for an investor.\nAll protocols should be audited to keep away from potential losses caused by code vulnerabilities.\nThe aggregated financial management protocol should count on a long-term safety operation record and obtains communities' permission via voting.

The deposit and loan interest rates of users on both sides of the borrower and lenders are calculated by algorithms based on the platform's borrowing volume and deposit volume, and the platform uses Chainlink's oracle to ensure the fairness of the collateral price. According to the data of DeFi Pulse, as of March 30, 2022, Aave's total fund lock-up volume was approximately US$11.79 billion, ranking second in DeFi application lock-up volume.\nCurve\nCurve is a decentralized exchange deployed on Ethereum. Curve is designed for trading between stablecoins with low fees and slippage through an automated market maker protocol. It is a decentralized liquidity aggregator, and anyone can add their own assets to the liquidity pool to earn market-making benefits. According to the data of DeFi Pulse, as of March 30, 2022, Curve's total fund lock-up volume was approximately US$10.79 billion, ranking third in DeFi application lock-up volume.\nConvex\nConvex is a one-stop platform for CRV staking and liquidity mining on Ethereum that is dedicated to simplifying the use of Curve. As a yield aggregator on the Ethereum chain, Convex aims to use the CVX token to simplify the process of locking and staking Curve and CRV through a simple and easy-to-use interface, and to improve the compensation of CRV token holders and liquidity providers. This facilitates the development of the CRV ecosystem. According to the data of DeFi Pulse, as of March 30, 2022, Convex's total locked funds amounted to about $10.1 billion, ranking fourth in DeFi applications.\nUniswap\nUniswap is a decentralized exchange deployed on Ethereum. The Uniswap protocol facilitates automated transactions between cryptocurrency tokens on the Ethereum blockchain through smart contracts. As of October 2020, Uniswap is estimated to be the largest decentralized exchange and the fourth largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume. According to the data of DeFi Pulse, as of March 30, 2022, Uniswap's total locked funds amounted to about $7.04 billion, ranking sixth in DeFi applications.\nBalancer\nBalancer is a decentralized exchange deployed on Ethereum. Balancer uses automatic market makers to achieve the function of decentralized transactions. Transaction users can choose trading pairs to trade and pay transaction fees, while liquidity providers can get a share of the fees. According to the data of DeFi Pulse, as of March 30, 2022, Balancer's total fund lock-up volume was about 2.19 billion US dollars, ranking 6th in DeFi application lock-up volume.\nSushiSwap\nSushiSwap was originally a fork of Uniswap, built upon Uniswap's code, while introducing some key differences. One of the biggest differences is that rewards are issued in SUSHI tokens. SushiSwap's liquidity providers are rewarded with the protocol's native token, SUSHI, which is also a governance token. Unlike Uniswap (UNI), SUSHI holders can continue to earn yields even after they cease to provide liquidity. According to DeFi Pulse, as of March 30, 2022, among the rankings of centralized exchanges, Sushiswap's total lock-up volume of funds was approximately US$1.68 billion, ranking 11th in DeFi application lock-up volume.\nQuickswap\nQuickswap is a layer2 decentralized exchange, similar to Uniswap and Sushiswap, using the AMM method. Anyone can invest money on Quickswap, provide liquidity, and earn income by staking liquidity tokens again. Quickswap's token, QUICK, is used as a governance token, and holders can submit proposals for changes to the protocol. According to the data of DeFi Pulse, as of March 30, 2022, among the rankings of centralized exchanges, Quickswap's total locked funds amounted to about US$473 million, ranking 22nd among DeFi applications.\nDODO\nDODO is a decentralized trading platform that uses an original Proactive Market Maker (PMM) algorithm to provide efficient on-chain liquidity for Web3 assets, allowing everyone to easily issue and trade Web3 assets. DODO not only provides liquidity by itself, but also aggregates the liquidity of other exchanges. This allows DODO to offer the best prices on the entire network. According to the data of DeFi Pulse, as of March 30, 2022, DODO's total fund lock-up volume was approximately US$47,700 million, ranking 52nd in DeFi application lock-up volume.\ndForce\ndForce is committed to building an integrated and interoperable matrix of open financial protocols and currency protocols, including lending protocols (global liquidity pools, interest-earning markets), asset-based protocols (multi-currency stablecoins, synthetic assets, etc.), liquidity aggregators, automatic market makers, etc. As of March 30, 2022, dForce's total lock-up volume of funds was approximately US$15,400, and DeFi applications ranked 69th in lock-up volume.\nSynapse\nSynapse was upgraded and renamed from Nerve Finance, an anonymous cross-chain liquidity protocol on the original BNB Chain.\nSynapse adopts cross-chain multi-party computation (MPC) validator and threshold signature scheme to support assets, smart contract calls, etc. Synapse connects different blockchains for easy and secure interoperability; developers can also build real cross-chain applications, including cross-chain DEXs, lending platforms, margin systems, derivatives markets, income aggregators, and more.\nVenus\nVenus is a synthetic stablecoin-driven decentralized currency market system on the BNB Chain, providing users with cryptocurrency lending solutions without the need for any third-party custody of funds or centralized entities to exercise more control over the protocol.\nBorrowers on Venus can get instant loans in stablecoins after holding cryptocurrency. This enables users to obtain additional funds without having to sell their non-stablecoin digital assets. On the other hand, lenders can deposit stablecoins (and other different cryptocurrencies) on the platform to earn passive income. What makes Venus unique is how it promotes its own synthetic stablecoin within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The synthetic stablecoins can maintain stable long-term value without holding the real-world assets they are pegged to (such as through algorithms, ecosystem incentive schemes, or using other forms of collateral).\nPancakeswap\nPancakeswap is a decentralized exchange on BNB Chain. Users can earn market-making income by providing liquidity to the platform, and earn Cake tokens by staking.\nAlpaca\nAlpaca is the largest lending protocol on the BNB Chain that provides leveraged farms. Alpaca helps lenders earn income and provides borrowers with leveraged farm position loans with insufficient collateral, which maximizes the principal benefit of farmers' mining and can generate multiple returns.\nIncorporated Oracle\nOracles are data sources that connect Ethereum to off-chain, real-world information so that user can query data in smart contracts. It allows certain smart contracts to respond to the uncertain external world, and is the only way for smart contracts to interact with the outside world, and it is also the interface between blockchain and the real world.\nChainlink\nChainlink is a decentralized oracle network that bridges the gap between smart contracts (like those on Ethereum) and their external data. The blockchain itself cannot connect to external applications in a trusted manner. Chainlink is not a single network of oracles, but an ecosystem of many decentralized oracle networks running in parallel, whose token is LINK.\nProtocol Contract Address\nEthereum\n\n\n\nBOC Contract\n3rd Party Protocol Contract\n\n\n\n\nVault\n\n\n\nBalancer3CrvStrategy\nBalancer Vault\n\n\nDodoUsdtUsdcStrategy\nDSP DODOMine\n\n\nDodoDaiUsdtStrategy\nDSP DODOMine\n\n\nSushiKashiUsdcLinkStrategy\nKashiPairMediumRiskV1\n\n\nSushiKashiUsdtXsushiStrategy\nKashiPairMediumRiskV1\n\n\nSushiKashiUsdtWethStrategy\nKashiPairMediumRiskV1\n\n\nSushiKashiUsdcWethStrategy\nKashiPairMediumRiskV1\n\n\nSushiKashiUsdcXsushiStrategy\nKashiPairMediumRiskV1\n\n\nConvexIronBankKrwStrategy\nIron Ban iKrw, Curve.fi Factory Plain Pool ibKRW\n\n\nConvexIronBankJpyStrategy\nIron Ban iJPY, Curve.fi Factory Plain Pool ibJPY\n\n\nConvexIronBankGbpStrategy\nIron Ban iGBP, Curve.fi Factory Plain Pool ibGBP\n\n\nConvexIronBankEurStrategy\nIron Ban iEUR, Curve.fi Factory Plain Pool ibEUR\n\n\nConvexIronBankChfStrategy\nIron Ban iCHF, Curve.fi Factory Plain Pool ibCHF\n\n\nConvexIronBankAudStrategy\nIron Ban iUSDT, Curve.fi Factory Plain Pool ibAUD\n\n\nConvex3CrvStrategy\nCurve.fi DAI/USDC/USDT Pool\n\n\nConvexBusdStrategy\nCurve.fi BUSD Swap\n\n\nConvexLusdStrategy\nLUSD3CRV-f\n\n\nConvexBusdV2Strategy\nCurve.fi BUSD V2\n\n\nConvexYStrategy\nCurve.fi y Swap\n\n\nConvexUsdtStrategy\nCurve.fi USDT Swap\n\n\nConvexTusdStrategy\nTUSD3CRV-f\n\n\nConvexPaxStrategy\npax-usdp3\n\n\nConvexCompoundStrategy\nCurve.fi Compound Swap\n\n\nConvexAaveStrategy\nCurve.fi aDAI/aUSDC/aUSDT Pool\n\n\nYearnEarnTusdStrategy\nyearn yTUSD Token\n\n\nGUniUsdcDai100Strategy\nGelato Uniswap DAI/USDC LP\n\n\n\nBNB Chain\n\n\n\nBOC Contract\n3rd Party Protocol Contract\n\n\n\n\nVault\n\n\n\nPancakeDaiBusdStrategy\nPancakeSwap Router v2 PancakeSwap Main Staking Contract\n\n\nPancakeTusdBusdStrategy\nPancakeSwap Router v2 PancakeSwap Main Staking Contract\n\n\nPancakeUsdcBusdStrategy\nPancakeSwap Router v2 PancakeSwap Main Staking Contract\n\n\nPancakeUsdcUsdtStrategy\nPancakeSwap Router v2 PancakeSwap Main Staking Contract\n\n\nPancakeUsdtBusdStrategy\nPancakeSwap Router v2 PancakeSwap Main Staking Contract\n\n\nAlpacaTusdStrategy\nibTUSD\n\n\nAlpacaUsdtStrategy\nibUSDT\n\n\nAlpacaBusdStrategy\nibBUSD\n\n\nVenusTusdStrategy\nvTUSD\n\n\nVenusUsdtStrategy\nVUSDT\n\n\nVenusUsdcStrategy\nvUSDC\n\n\nVenusDaiStrategy\nvDAI\n\n\nVenusBusdStrategy\nvBUSD\n\n\nBelt4BeltStrategy\nbeltPair MasterBelt\n\n\nDodoBusdUsdcStrategy\nDODO\n\n\nDodoBusdUsdtStrategy\nDODO\n\n\nDForceLendBusdStrategy\niBUSD\n\n\nDForceLendDaiStrategy\niDAI\n\n\nDForceLendUsdcStrategy\niUSDC\n\n\nDForceLendUsdtStrategy\niUSDT\n\n\nSynapse4UStrategy\nSwapFlashLoan Synapse MiniChef\n\n\n\nPolygon\n\n\n\nBOC Contract\n3rd Party Protocol Contract\n\n\n\n\nVault\n\n\n\nCurve3CrvStrategy\nCurve.fi Aave Pool Curve.fi Aave Gauge\n\n\nAaveUsdtStrategy\nAave Lending Pool V2 Aave Incentives Controller V2\n\n\nAaveUsdcStrategy\nAave Lending Pool V2 Aave Incentives Controller V2\n\n\nBalancerUsdcUsdtDaiTusdStrategy\nBalancer Vault\n\n\nQuickswapDaiUsdtStrategy\nStakingRewards\n\n\nQuickswapUsdcDaiStrategy\nStakingRewards\n\n\nQuickswapUsdcUsdtStrategy\nStakingRewards\n\n\nSushiUsdcUsdtStrategy\nSushiSwap Router SushiSwap MiniChef\n\n\nSushiUsdcDaiStrategy\n\n\n\nSynapse4UStrategy\nSwapFlashLoan Synapse MiniChef\n\n\nDodoUsdtUsdcStrategy\nDODO DODOMine\n\n\n\n"},"how-it-works/protocol-algorithm-design.html":{"url":"how-it-works/protocol-algorithm-design.html","title":"Protocol Algorithm Design","keywords":"","body":"Protocol Algorithm Design\nBOC provides the USD Stablecoins Farming and ETH Farming.\nUSD Stablecoins Farming Mechanism\nProcess Description\n\n\n“Deposit” - The BOC protocol supports users to deposit the three major stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI) in any combination and in any amount, and mint USDi of corresponding value to return to the user.\\\n“Withdraw” - Users can withdraw USDi all the three major stablecoins at any time through the BOC protocol. By default, they will be returned according to the proportion of the three major stablecoins in the Vault at that time, or they can specify a certain currency to be returned.\nAfter Vault receives the stablecoin, queryTokenPrice queries the price of the user's transfer of the stablecoin through an external oracle. When the price returned by the oracle is higher than 1 USD, it is calculated at 1 USD, and when it is lower than 1 USD, it is calculated at the price of the oracle.\nBased on the calculated value, mint/burn will mint/burn an equivalent value of USDi.\nThe Keeper module reaches the trigger condition of doHardWork and triggers doHardWork.\nVault calls the aggregate exchange module swapTokenToWants.\nThe aggregated exchange module swapTokens completes the exchange.\nVault receives the target currency exchanged by the aggregate exchange module.\nVault puts stablecoin deposits into the strategy according to the currency required by the strategy.\nThe strategy invests stablecoin deposits into third-party protocols.\nThe Keeper module reaches the harvest trigger condition and triggers the harvest.\nHarvester triggers each strategy to execute harvest.\nEach strategy executes claimRewards to collect mining.\nEach strategy transfers mining coins transferRewards to Harvester.\nHarvester sells miner sellRewards into stablecoins through aggregated exchange.\nHarvester sendProfitToVault transfers stablecoins into Vault.\nThe Keeper module reaches the rebase trigger condition and triggers the rebase.\nVault calls changeTotalSupply to issue additional USDi.\nVault collects 20% of the yields, which is transferred to the Treasury.\nThe treasury will benefit users from using buyback to repurchase the BOC governance token.\n\nMint & Burn rules\nHere is a numerical example of minting and burning USDi tokens.\nLet’s assume that Alice deposits 100 USDT, 100 DAI and 100 USDC.\nAccording to the BOC mint rule: the transaction price is 1 USD when the price from Chainlink is higher than 1 USD, otherwise the transaction price is equal to the price from Chainlink.\nThus, Alice will mint 299 USDi in total:\nThe current price from Chainlink is:\n\n1 USDT = 1.01 USD\n1 DAI = 0.99 USD\n1 USDC = 1.00 USD\n\n100 USDT = 100 x 1.00 = 100 USDi (price of Chainlink > 1 USD final price = 1 USD)\\\n100 DAI = 100 x 0.99 = 99 USDi (price of Chainlink \n\nNow, Alice decides to burn the USDi to withdraw her stablecoins. She has 299 USDi now and when she burns depending on the proportion of USDT/USDC/DAI of the Vault the burning smart contract will distribute the same proportion the USDi on each stablecoin, in this case when we redeem there is a little less of USDT on the Vault, so the distribution will be 99 of them for USDT, 100 of them for DAI, and the rest 100 for USDC. Assume the current price from Chainlink does not change.\nThe rule of burning is opposite to that of minting: the transaction price is 1 USD when the price from Chainlink is less than 1 USD, otherwise the transaction price is equal to the price from Chainlink.\nTherefore, Alice burns 299 USDi to withdraw:\nChainlink prices:\n\n1 USDT = 1.01 USD\n1 DAI = 0.99 USD\n1 USDC = 1.01 USD\n\n100 USDi = 100/1.01 = 99 USDT (price of Chainlink > 1 USD final price = Chainlink price)\\\n100 USDi = 100/1.00 = 100 DAI (price of Chainlink \n\nThe numbers in the chart here are only a numerical example for a better understanding of the rules of minting and burning in BOC. In the real world, the fluctuation of USDi is much smaller, which means users will never encounter a possible loss like this. In fact, the possible loss here will be less than 0.01%. The objective of these rules is to avoid arbitrage and protect the protocol's vault.\nHarvest\nThe harvestTrigger is triggered every day to determine whether the harvest condition is met.

At the same time, 20% of the additional USDi will be transferred to the DAO treasury as a management fee.\nFund Allocation\ndoHardWork\nThe input into the position adjustment of the algorithm are the official APY of the third-party protocol, the gas required for investment of each strategy, the limit of exchange slippage, and the rules of fund allocation, and the strategy and amount of the funds to be invested are the output.\n\n\n\nSet parameters\nETH\nBNB Chain\nPolygon\n\n\n\n\nScheduled Task Trigger Cycle\n7 am every Wed. & Sat.\n7 am every Wed. & Sat.\n7 am every Wed. & Sat.\n\n\nCost-benefit Calculation Period X (If the profit of investment X days >= cost, “doHardwork” can be done)\n365 days\n365 days\n365 days\n\n\n\nAllocation\nCompared with doHardWork, allocation has done one more step: take out the funds of the low APY strategy, and then use the official APY of the third-party protocols, the gas required for investment of each strategy, the exchange slippage limit, fund allocation rules, the position adjustment algorithm as an input, and the output is the strategy and the amount of the awaiting investment funds.\n\n\n\nSet parameters\nETH\nBNB Chain\nPolygon\n\n\n\n\nPre-adjusted position report trigger timing\n6:50 am every day\n6:50 am every day\n6:50 am every day\n\n\nScheduled task trigger cycle\n7 am every Monday\n7 am every Monday\n7 am every Monday\n\n\nCost-benefit calculation period X (If the profit of rebalancing X days >= cost, “allocation” can be done)\n30 days\n30 days\n30 days\n\n\n\nFund allocation Algorithm\n\n\n\nVariable\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\"durationDays\"\nThe cycle of rebalancing needs to ensure that in a cycle after rebalancing, the profit after rebalancing - the profit before rebalancing - the cost of rebalancing > 0\n\n\n\"yearDays\"\n365days\n\n\n\"asset1\"\nThe original assets of the strategy\n\n\n\"apr1\"\nThe strategy apr before the position adjustment (APY needs to be converted into apr), the current value of the APY of the position adjustment algorithm is the 7-day average of APY calculated outside the strategy chain\n\n\n\"deltaAsset\"\nAssume the capital change value of the strategy rebalancing\n\n\n\"poolAssets1\"\nThe TVL of the strategic target investment pool is used as a parameter for the change of apr after the position adjustment\n\n\n\nProfit before position adjustment\n$$\ngain1 = \\frac{asset1 \\times apr1 \\times durationDays}{yearDays}\n$$\nChanged earnings\n$$\ngain2 = \\frac{(asset1+deltaAsset-exchangeLoss)\\times apr2 \\times durationDays}{yearDays}\n$$\nchanged apr\n$$\napr2 = \\frac{apr1 \\times poolAssets1}{(poolAssets1+deltaAsset-exchangeLoss)}\n$$\nAfter substituting apr2 in gain2 using the above equation:\n$$\ngain2=\\frac{apr1 \\times durationDays/yearDays \\times (asset1+deltaAsset) \\times poolAssets1}{poolAssets1+deltaAsset-exchangeLoss}\n$$\nThen the relationship between the changed income of a single strategy and the changed assets is:\n$$\ndeltaGain = gain2-gain1 = \\frac{deltaAsset \\times (poolAsset1-asset1) \\times apr1 \\times durationDays}{(poolAsset1+deltaAsset-exchangeLoss) \\times yearDays}\n$$\nCost of changing funds for a single strategy\n\n\n\nvariable name\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nwithdrawFee\nWithdrawal Fund Handling Fee\n\n\nlendFee\nAdditional capital operation fee\n\n\nexchangeLoss\nExchange currency slippage loss\n\n\nharvestFee\n“harvest” Funding Fees\n\n\nprofitChangeFee\nCapital change cost\n\n\nwithdrawGas\nwithdrawGas is the gas consumed by the “withdraw” operation, which is estimated by pre-testing\n\n\nlendGas\nlendGas is the gas consumed by the “lend” operation, which is estimated by pre-testing\n\n\nexchangeLossRate\nRedeem Slippage\n\n\n\n$$\nprofitChangeFee=withdrawFee+lendFee+exchangeLoss+harvestFee\n$$\n$$\nwithdrawFee = gasPrice \\times withdrawGas\n$$\n$$\nlendFee= gasPrice \\times lendGas\n$$\n$$\nexchangeLoss=deltaAsset \\times exchangeLossRate\n$$\n$$\nharvestFee=harvestGas \\times durationDays\n$$\nFind the maximum sum of deltaGain for all strategies:\n$$\nprofitChange=MAX\\sum_{i=1}^m(deltaGain_i -withdrawFee_i-lendFee_i - exchangeLoss_i-harvestFee_i)\n$$\n$$\nprofitChange=MAX\\sum_{i=1}^m(\\frac{deltaAsset_i \\times (poolAsset_i-asset_i) \\times apr_i * durationDays_i}{(poolAsset_i+deltaAsset_i-exchangeLoss_i) \\times yearDays_i}\n$$\n$$\n\noperateFee_i - exchangeLoss_i - harvestFee_i)\n$$\n\nTotal Change Profit ProfitChange In this formula, the only variable is the deltaAsset for each strategy.

The sources of official APY are as follows: vfat.tools, coingecko, zapper, Official APY, apy.vision Fee, etc. If the official APY source channel does not include the APY calculation of the protocol strategy, the BOC directly copies the official APY calculation rules of the protocol strategy. Generally speaking, the official APY of the protocol strategy consists of market-making revenue and mining coin revenue. Taking the “ConvexLusdStrategy” strategy that BOC has already docked as an example, its APY consists from the contents of following table:\n\n\n\nAPY Mark\nAPR\nAPY\nCompound Interest\nCalculation Method\nData Source\n\n\n\n\nTrx Fee\n0.0024\nTx Fee\nN\nAPI\nhttps://www.convexfinance.com/api/curve-apys\n\n\ncrv\n0.023523458\ncvx mining coins\nY\nAPI\nhttps://www.convexfinance.com/api/curve-apys\n\n\ncvx\n0.024132445\ncvx mining coins\nY\nContract Calculation\nIssued according to time, one-year mining coin price/total pool assets can get APR\n\n\n\n$$\nAPY=(1+APR)^{periods}-1\n$$\nThe “periods” parameter is the interest payment period.\nStrategy Actual APY Calculation Rules\nThe actual APY of the strategy is calculated based on the standard return of the strategy currency.\nETH Farming Mechanism\nThe mechanism of ETH farming is exactly the same as that of the USD stablecoins farming at present. The only difference is that the collateral of USD stablecoins is USDi, thus, that of ETH is called ETHi.\n"},"more/appendix.html":{"url":"more/appendix.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"Glossary\nGlossary\nBlockchain network\nBlockchain is a system that records information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. It encrypts data blocks (smart contracts, transactions, etc.) and links them together to form a chronologically single source of accurate data. Blockchain’s inherent security measures and public ledger make it a prime technology for almost every single sector. The blockchain community participates from this block adding by different consensus mechanism.\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine is the software platform that developers can use to create decentralized applications (DApps) on Ethereum. This virtual machine is where all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live.\nCryptocurrency\nA cryptocurrency is a native token on a blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are typically minted with each new block added to the chain. For instance, each new block of Ethereum mined comes with a reward of two ether tokens as compensation to the miner.\nCryptocurrencies are a type of token. Their nativity is their defining factor: other tokens are created using platforms and applications built on top of blockchains, while cryptocurrencies are built within a blockchain protocol.\nConsensus mechanism\nA consensus mechanism is a fault-tolerant mechanism that is used in computer and blockchain systems to achieve the necessary agreement on a single data value or a single state of the network among distributed processes or multiagent systems, such as with cryptocurrencies. It is useful in record-keeping, among other things. By the moment, the most used mechanisms are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).\nProof of work\nProof of work is a consensus mechanism through which blocks are added to a blockchain. PoW requires miners to solve complicated cryptographic puzzles, which demand large amounts of energy from powerful mining rigs in order to validate new blockchain transactions.\nPoW is a safe and decentralized consensus mechanism, but it's notoriously inefficient. This is how Bitcoin and the first version of Ethereum blockchains operate, although Ethereum will soon shift to the more efficient 'Proof of Stake’ protocol.\nProof of stake\nConfronted with the huge energy demands of PoW, proof of stake is an updated consensus mechanism that allows blocks to be mined much more efficiently. POS allows holders of a cryptocurrency to validate new blocks onto the relevant blockchain.\nThey do this by staking their cryptocurrency. In other words, they may have the opportunity to validate a new block, if their stake is chosen by a randomized algorithm, and they'll get a reward in cryptocurrency for it. The more cryptocurrency staked, the more chances the user has to be chosen to validate a new block.\nWhere PoW rewards those who have spent the most computational power to solve a cryptographic puzzle, proof of stake rewards those who invest their cryptocurrency over a long period of time.\nDistributed Autonomous Organization (DAO)\nCan be defined as an organization on a blockchain, represented by a set of rules encoded in a computer program on a blockchain, that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government.\nDAOs Treasury\nTreasuries help DAOs fund critical development, attract contributors and grow their network. Anything in a DAO that can be automated should be and anything that can’t be should be funded by the treasury.\nPrinciples of Treasury Management:\n\nMaintain an infinite time horizon: The treasury should be structured to exist in perpetuity (however, treasuries may be dissolved in certain situations).\nEnsure inflows exceed outflows: Over the long run, revenue from the protocol plus returns of the treasury should exceed spending.\nDiversify: Treasury allocations should ensure that critical expenses can be funded even if the protocol token has a significant drawdown.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\nDecentralized finance (commonly known as DeFi) is a kind of finance created on the blockchain. It does not rely on financial institutions such as brokerages, exchanges or banks to provide financial tools, but uses smart contracts on the blockchain (such as Ethereum) for financial activities. DeFi platforms allow people to lend or borrow funds from others, trade cryptocurrencies and earn interest in savings-like accounts.\nImpermanent loss (IL)\nImpermanent loss happens when you provide liquidity to a liquidity pool, and the price of your deposited assets changes compared to when you deposited them. The bigger this change is, the more you are exposed to impermanent loss. In this case, the loss means less dollar value at the time of withdrawal than at the time of deposit. Impermanent loss is the risk that liquidity providers (LP) take in exchange for fees they earn in liquidity pools. If IL exceeds fees earned by a user when they withdraw, it means the user has suffered negative returns compared with simply holding their tokens outside the pool.\nSlippage\nIn crypto trade, slippage refers to a difference in price between buyer and seller expectations. Slippage can lead to a final sale price of the asset that is either more or less than the requested transaction amount.\nDashboard\nA crypto dashboard is a digital platform that lives on a website or in an app (either desktop or mobile). Its main function is to accept all the crypto accounts and/or coins you add to it to monitor their ever-shifting value so that you can manage both your crypto assets and related financial plans accordingly.\nSmart contract\nA smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network. The code controls the execution, and transactions are trackable and irreversible.\nAutomated Market Maker (AMM)\nAn Automated Market Maker (AMM) is an autonomous trading mechanism that eliminates the need for centralized trading and related market making techniques. It encourages users to become liquidity providers in exchange for a portion of transaction fees and free tokens.\nProactive Market Maker (PMM)\nEssentially, the difference with AMM is that the algorithm checks the prices of assets allocating funds to proactively increase liquidity near the market price. An example of a DeFi that uses PMM is DODO\nOver-collateralized loans\nOver-collateralization is one technique that may be used for credit enhancement. In this case, the issuer backs a loan with assets or collateral which has a value that is in excess of the loan. That limits the credit risk for the creditor and enhances the credit rating assigned to the loan.\nProtocol\nProtocol is a set of codes or requirements that regulate how a blockchain works. It sets out a broad set of rules, such as the interface of the blockchain, the interaction of participating computers, the types of data that should be shared, Incentives for developers participating in the network and more.\nLending Protocol\nLending Protocol is a platform composed of lenders and borrowers. On the one hand, it allows lenders to borrow cryptocurrencies from the platform and pay interest, and on the other hand, it allows depositors to deposit cryptocurrencies to the platform to earn interest. DeFi lending protocols can often offer much higher interest rates compared to bank deposit accounts.\nCollateral\nIn DeFi, collateral refers to the offer of one cryptocurrency or token as \"collateral\" to secure a different cryptocurrency or token loan.\nVolume\nVolume refers to the amount of traded assets over a period of time, usually over the course of a trading day.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity measures the circulating supply and how much trading activity there in an exchange, economy, or network. A currency with low supply and/or circulation is said to be illiquid.\nLiquidity Pool\nA Liquidity Pool is a pool of funds meant to provide liquidity to a currency, network, or Smart Contract. There are usually designed rewards or incentives given to those who provide liquidity to Liquidity Pools. See also (Liquidity Mining)[].\nYield Aggregators\nYield Aggregators is an aggregation platform that supports multiple DeFi protocols. It can automatically move positions between various DeFi protocols that provide liquidity mining, helping users to obtain higher returns.\nVaults\nVaults is a complex investment strategy that combines lending, staking, trading, etc. to maximize profits.\nKeeper\nThe centralized timer developed by the BOC project is used for timing triggering of on-chain tasks (harvesting, rebalancing, reinvestment of incremental funds, etc.).\nAnnual Yield (APY)\nAnnual percentage yield is a way of measuring how much money an investment account makes in a year, a way of measuring the rise in interest over time. The basic calculation formula is:\n$$\nAPY=(1+APR)^{periods}-1\n$$\nParameter “periods” is the interest payment periods.\nStrategy\nStrategy refers to smart contracts that interface with third-party agreements. BOC Vault has multiple strategies, and the strategy is one-to-one with external third-party protocols.\nOracle\nOracles are the bridge between the blockchain and the real world. Oracles act as on-chain APIs that can be queried for information to smart contracts including but not limited to price information. BOC uses Chainlink a high-rated decentralized oracle, making oracle attacks really improbable.\nArbitrage\nArbitrage involves buying and selling two related assets in two different markets in order to leverage the price or rate differential between the markets into risk-free profits. This, if not contemplated, can lead to asset losses in the vault. See more here.\nBurn\nBurning assets (coins or tokens) means eliminating USDi by sending them to a null address, which is not accessible by anyone, since no one owns the private keys to that address. Users must burn the “tradable tokens” that attempt to accrue value in order to receive the “proprietary payment tokens” for the service in network. On BOC the user burns USDi when they redeem and receive the stablecoin selected.\nMint\nIn cryptocurrency, minting is a decentralized method that enables a person to generate a new token without the involvement of a central authority, such as the government or the bank. It can either be a non-fungible token or a crypto coin. In this case, in BOC through a smart contract the user mints USDi and that are transfer to their wallets when they deposit stablecoins.\nStablecoin\nA stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that has its value pegged to the value of a stable asset. Stable coins are most commonly pegged to the US Dollar but can be pegged to other assets like gold or a basket of crypto assets.\nCircular dependencies\nA circular dependency is a relation between two or more modules which either directly or indirectly depend on each other to function properly. On DeFi multi-strategies protocols this would be when \"protocol A\" invest on \"protocol B\", at the same \"protocol B\" invest on \"protocol A\" leading to a real big risk for the protocol's stability.\nToken\nSimilar to a type of coin but with much greater functionality. Tokens can also be used as a method of payment like coins, but unlike coins, they can excel at other use cases such as the democratic governance of a protocol or system, or as a means to use underlying coins to make liquidity tokens from these coin deposits.\nGovernance Token\nGovernance token are tokens that carries the right to take part in governance processes. Governance refers to determining, maintaining, adapting and enforcing the rules of a blockchain ecosystem, product, project or DAO.\nLego Combination\nA fundamental tenet in DeFi is to build for interoperability. This allows the ecosystem to benefit from individual progress, continuously pushing decentralized finance. As participants build useful things, they can be shared and combined in new ways, reminiscent of everyone’s favourite toy, Lego. When new people dive into the Lego ‘bin’, they find individual Legos or preassembled combinations which they also start to build with, creating bigger and better things.\nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs)\nDEXs are blockchain-based apps that coordinate large-scale trading of crypto assets between many users. They do that entirely through automated algorithms, instead of the conventional approach of acting as financial intermediary between buyers and sellers.\nBridge\nBlockchain bridges work just like the bridges we know in the physical world. Just as a physical bridge connects two physical locations, a blockchain bridge connects two blockchain ecosystems. Bridges facilitate communication between blockchains through the transfer of information and assets.\nWallet\nA software application or hardware cryptocurrency wallet that can hold a variety of coins.\nAcronym\n\n\n\nword\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nAMM\nAutomated market makers\n\n\nPMM\nProactive market makers\n\n\nAPI\nApplication Programming Interface\n\n\nAPY\nAnnual percentage yield\n\n\nBOC\nBank Of Chain\n\n\nDAO\nDistributed Autonomous Organization\n\n\nDAPP / dApp\nDecentralized Application\n\n\nDeFi\nDecentralized Finance\n\n\nDEX\nDecentralized Exchange\n\n\nEVM\nEthereum Virtual Machine\n\n\nFX\nForeign Exchange\n\n\nKYC\nKnow Your Customer\n\n\nLP\nLiquidity Provider\n\n\nPEG\nPrice/earnings-to-growth\n\n\nPoW\nProof of Work\n\n\nPoS\nProof of Stake\n\n\nPoSA\nProof of Stake Authority\n\n\nTVL\nTotal Value Locked\n\n\nTx\nTransaction\n\n\n\n"},"more/faqs.html":{"url":"more/faqs.html","title":"FAQs","keywords":"","body":"FAQs\nBlockchain FAQs\nWhat is blockchain?\nBlockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. It encrypted blocks of data then chains them together to form a chronological single-source-of-truth for the data. Blockchain’s inherent security measures and public ledger make it a prime technology for almost every single sector.\nWhat problem blockchain solves?\nDigital assets are easily copied and redistributed. On music and film industry it's a big problem, anyone can copy songs and movies and distribute them. Blockchain technology provides a database where is register every movement, and it can be distinguished when something is original or not. This is fits perfect with digital currency. We can distinguish one token (like a USDT) from another, assets can now be managed on a decentralized way.\nWhat is the difference between cryptocurrency and blockchain?\nBlockchain makes cryptos possible. It's what manage cryptocurrency. There is several blockchains networks, to use them is usual that you have to pay a gas fee, for this you need to pay on the native cryptocurrency. If you use the Polygon blockchain you need Matic to pay the fee. This fee is the incentive to people to participate on the process and contribute to the safety of the blockchain network.\nWhat are Decentralized Finances?\nDecentralized finance (commonly known as DeFi) is a kind of real world finance but is created on the blockchain. It uses smart contracts on the blockchain (such as Ethereum) for financial activities. DeFi platforms allow people to lend or borrow funds to others, trade cryptocurrencies, and earn interest in savings-like accounts, all this without a centralized institution.\nBank of Chain (BOC) FAQs\nWhat blockchains are compatible with the BOC platform?\nBy the moment BOC is compatible the following blockchain networks:\n\nBNB chain\nEthereum\nPolygon\n\nWhat wallets are compatible with BOC?\nTo interact with BOC you can use MetaMask or WalletConnect.\nWhat stablecoins are incorporated for deposit on BOC?\nBOC is on version beta 1.5 and receive deposits on USDT, USDC & DAI.\nHow much time should pass to withdraw my deposit?\nNone, it isn't locked time required to withdraw our assets.\nWhy BOC is secure?\nBOC ensure it's safety being audited regularly as well as the integrated DeFi protocols. At the same time, BOC does not use unofficial third-party cross-chain bridges for transactions and the price quotation always relies on Chainlink, a market-leading oracle.\nWhat stablecoins can I deposit and withdraw?\nBOC currently provides users to deposit and withdraw USDT, USDC and DAI in any combination and in any amount. When depositing stablecoins, USDi of equivalent value will be minted as a collateral, which will be burned when users want to withdraw their stablecoins.\nWhat is USDi? Can I use it to reinvest or do anything?\nUSDi is a collateral minted by users when they deposit stablecoins. The returns that users obtain via BOC protocol will be reflected in the increased amount of USDi in their wallet. USDi is pegged 1:1 as USD, in other word, it shows the user’s net USD value in BOC protocol. USDi is only a collateral which will be burned when withdrawing, it cannot be used for other financial activities.\nWhen will the BOC token be issued?\nIt will be issued in June 2022.\nHow often will my balance increase once I have USDi or ETHi?\nThe amount of USDi or ETHi in your wallet will grow each time there is a positive rebase event. You can read more about this in Rebase. Currently, rebase are triggered once a day and is usually correlated with how many people are minting and burning in a day.\nWhat are the costs to mint and burn USDi and ETHi?\nAnytime you mint or burn, there will be an exchange rate applied to your stablecoins deposited or withdrawn，and the exchange rate depends on Oracles, which can be varied. See more details in Mint & Burn. The aim of this mechanism here is to protect the protocol from arbitrage, BOC protocol charge nothing in this process.\nIs there a minimum or maximum amount to deposit?\nYou can deposit any amount you want, there is no minimum or maximum limit.\nHow much will I earn?\nEach asset has its own market of supply and demand with its own APY (Annual Percentage Yield) which evolves with time. You can find the average annual rate over the past 30 days to evaluate the rate evolution, and you can also find more data on the reserve overview of each asset in the Dashboard of BOC.\nGlossary\nIf you are unsure about any specific terms feel free to check the Glossary.\n"},"more/references.html":{"url":"more/references.html","title":"References","keywords":"","body":"References\n\nCousaert, S., Xu, J., & Matsui, T.
