# Bank of Chain Documentation

## Introduction.

Official documentation for BOC. This repo is used to sync changes from Markdown files (.md) with the DOC's website. Different GitHub branches are tracked by GitBook to feed each language variant.

## Updating versions

Use the following steps to update a specific version. For example, to update the Chinese docs:

- Clone the repo and change to the branch you want to work on.
```
git clone https://github.com/Bank-of-Chain-DAO/gitbook_boc.git
git checkout zh
```
- You will update, ```add``` and ```commit``` everything and push the zh branch to Github
```
git add .
git commit -m "new commit"
git push
```
- Go to documentation website and confirm everything updated as expected. It may take a minute or two for the changes to sync.
