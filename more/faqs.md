## Blockchain FAQs

### What is blockchain?

Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. It encrypts blocks of data and chains them together to form a chronological single-source-of-truth for the data. Blockchain’s inherent security measures and public ledger make it a prime technology for almost every single sector.

### What problem does the blockchain solve?

Digital assets are easily copied and redistributed. On music and film industry it's a severe problem, that anyone can copy songs and movies and distribute them. Blockchain technology provides a database where it is registered every movement, and it can be distinguished whether it is authentic. This fits perfectly with the digital currency. We can distinguish one token (like a USDT) from another, and assets can now be managed in a decentralized way.

### What is the difference between cryptocurrency and blockchain?

Blockchain makes cryptos possible. It is an essential tool that manages cryptocurrency. There are several blockchain networks. To use them, you are usually required to pay a gas fee with native cryptocurrencies. For instance, if the Polygon blockchain is used, you are required to pay with Matic. This fee is an incentive for people to participate in the process and contribute to the safety of the blockchain network.

### What are Decentralized Finances?

Decentralized finance (commonly known as DeFi) is real-world finance that is created on the blockchain. It uses smart contracts on the blockchain (such as Ethereum) for financial activities. DeFi platforms allow people to lend or borrow funds to others, trade cryptocurrencies and earn interests in savings-like accounts. These are all without a centralized institution.

## Bank of Chain (BOC) FAQs

### What blockchains are compatible with the BOC platform?

At present, BOC is compatible with the following blockchain networks:

* BNB chain
* Ethereum
* Polygon

### What wallets are compatible with BOC?

To [interact with BOC](https://github.com/Francisco-Rua/boc\_gitbook/blob/master/more/user-handbook/README.md#wallet-connection) MetaMask or WalletConnect is preferred.

### What stablecoins are incorporated for deposit on BOC?

BOC is on version beta 1.5 and receives [deposits](https://github.com/Francisco-Rua/boc\_gitbook/blob/master/more/user-handbook/README.md#deposit) on USDT, USDC & DAI.

### How much time should pass to withdraw deposits?

None. There is no locked time required to [withdraw](https://github.com/Francisco-Rua/boc\_gitbook/blob/master/more/user-handbook/README.md#withdrawal) your assets.

### Why BOC is secure?

BOC ensures its safety by being audited regularly as well as the integrated DeFi protocols. Moreover, BOC does not use unauthorised third-party cross-chain bridges for transactions and the price quotation always relies on [Chainlink](https://chain.link/), a market-leading oracle.

### What stablecoins can I deposit and withdraw?

BOC currently allows users to deposit and withdraw USDT, USDC and DAI in any combination and in any amount. When depositing stablecoins, USDi of equivalent value will be minted as a collateral, which will be burned when users wish to withdraw their stablecoins.

### What is USDi? Can I use it to reinvest or do anything?

USDi is a collateral minted by users when they deposit stablecoins. The returns that users obtain via BOC protocol will be reflected in the increased amount of USDi in their wallet. USDi is pegged 1:1 to USD, i.e., it shows the user’s net USD value in the BOC protocol. USDi is only a collateral which will be burned when withdrawing, it cannot be used for other financial activities.

### When will the BOC token be issued?

It will be issued in June 2022.

### How often will my balance increase once I have USDi or ETHi?

The amount of USDi or ETHi in your wallet will grow each time there is a positive rebase event. You can read more on this in [Rebase](https://github.com/Francisco-Rua/boc\_gitbook/blob/master/more/protocol-algorithm-design/README.md#rebase). Currently, rebase are triggered once daily and is usually correlated to the amount of people minting and burning in a day.

### What are the costs to mint and burn USDi and ETHi?

During each minting or burning, there will be an exchange rate applied to your stablecoins deposited or withdrawn，and the exchange rate depends on [Oracles](appendix.md#oracle), which varies. See more details in [Mint & Burn](https://github.com/Francisco-Rua/boc\_gitbook/blob/master/more/protocol-algorithm-design/README.md#mint--burn). The aim of this mechanism here is to protect the protocol from arbitrage and it is a non-profitable process. 

### Is there a minimum or maximum amount to deposit?

You can deposit any amount that you desire. There is no minimum or maximum limit.

### How much will I earn?

Each asset has its own market of supply and demand with its corresponding APY (Annual Percentage Yield) which evolves with time. You can find the average annual rate over the past 30 days to evaluate the rate evolution, and you can also find more data on the reserve overview of each asset in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard-v1.bankofchain.io/#/) of BOC.
